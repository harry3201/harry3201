ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Harshad!
ðŸ‘€ Curious about the realms of MERN Stack and AI, constantly seeking to innovate and create real-world solutions.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm delving into learning MERN , refining my skills to engineer seamless experiences and robust systems.

ðŸŽ¯ I'm actively seeking collaborative opportunities to engineer the future, whether it's building scalable applications or pioneering AI-driven technologies. Let's join forces and engineer something extraordinary!

ðŸ“« Drop me a line at h.incworks@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn. I'm always eager to connect with fellow engineers and visionaries.

âš¡ Fun fact: The first computer bug was an actual moth found trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer in 1947, coining the term "debugging" in the world of engineering!
